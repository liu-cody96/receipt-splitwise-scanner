# receipt-splitwise-scanner
(WIP) Upload an image of your receipt and then enter who bought/is paying for which item and then this app will automatically and correctly split the bill :) 

-- a full-stack web application built on React/Flask/PostgreSQL allowing a user to login, upload an image of a receipt, parse out prices on that receipt via Asprise OCR API, and split the receipt costs with other users, similar to Splitwise.

-- Implemented automated unit testing via pytest and Github Actions

-- Implemented user authentication & registration using bcrypt and JWT. 

-- Containerized backend with Docker
