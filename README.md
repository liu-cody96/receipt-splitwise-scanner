# receipt-splitwise-scanner
(WIP) Upload an image of your receipt and then enter who bought/is paying for which item and then this app will automatically and correctly split the bill :) 

# to run the app, you need to run the frontend and then the backend.
# to run the backend: 
1. cd into backend folder
2. build image --> docker-compose up --build
3. to close out, hit Ctrl + C, then hit docker-compose stop 
4. to open image back up, docker-compose up

# to run the frontend: 
1. cd into frontend folder
2. repeat steps 2-4
